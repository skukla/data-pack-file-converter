Write a ruby program.
The program should use classes stored in lib/
The program should have a main.rb file that is the entry point for the application
The purpose of the program is to convert files between json and csv formats
The program will expect a file path to a single json or csv file

For the given file, the program will:
  Determine the file format
  Read the file's data
  Compare the file data's structure to a corresponding template file that has the desired shape of output
  For example, if a json file is passed, compare it's data to a corresponding csv template
  Conversely, if a csv file is passed, compare it's data to a corresponding json template
  Map the input file data to the output template
  Write a new output file
  For example, if settings.json is passed:
    Compare the data to a csv template file called settings.csv
    Map the json data into the csv format
    Write the new csv file called settings.csv
  If settings.csv is passed:
    Compare the data to a csv template file called settings.json
    Map the csv data into the json format
    Write the new json file called settings.json

Use separate classes for handling arguments, handling errors, handling file reading/writing, printing output, and mapping data
